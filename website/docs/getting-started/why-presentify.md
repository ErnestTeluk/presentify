title: Why Presentify?
---

There are a lot of solutions for presenting in mdx, such as [sli.dev](https://sli.dev/), [next-mdx-deck](https://next-mdx-deck.netlify.app/?mode=slideshow#0), [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) but none of them are in pure react.
Here are some advantages of this approach:

### MDX based

Presentify utilizes the MDX format to efficiently store and arrange your presentation slides in a single plain text file. This allows you to concentrate on creating your content without worrying about formatting.

### Integration with existing projects

Because Presentify uses pure react, it can be added very quickly to existing projects if we need a presentation in it.

### Themable

Presentify is built with [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) and which allows you to easily customize the appearance of your presentation. For code highlighting, Presentify uses [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) and you can easily use dark and light theme.

### Developer experience

Presentify is powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which provides a lightning-fast dev experience and allows you to use [React Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh) to instantly preview your changes. You can easily build your presentation for production with a single command.

### Hackable

Presentify is built with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), which means you can use any React component in your presentation.
